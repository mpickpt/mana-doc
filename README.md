MANA (MPI-Agnostic Network-Agnostic Checkpointing) is an implementation
of transparent checkpointing for MPI. It is built as a plugin on top
of the DMTCP checkpointing package (https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp).
DMTCP stands for "Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPpointing".

MANA provides three primary commands, along with others described in the + 
documentation.
* mana_coordinator
* mana_launch
* mana_restart

See https://mana-doc.readthedocs.io/ for details.
